revenue they provide to the countries through payment of high tuition or joining the countries work force the respective effort made to try and aid them
in one of the most common problem they face(Language) is minimal. Regardless of the amount of language classes offered, it still takes a considerable 
amount of time to be able to speak the native language present.
As such, this application provides a means for international students to communicate regardless of which country they have visited.
This is chieved by translating their language of choice to the language of the residents of the country of which they are in allowing for a means of communication
as 'fail safe' before they master the countries language.
